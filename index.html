            <p>Hello! My name is Alberto Gomez Arias and I currently live in Fort Worth, Texas.
                Moved here about 5 years ago from Colorado in order to be able to better provide
                for my family. Looking forward to continuing my education for increased opportunities
                both spiritually and in my career.
            </p>

            <P>"Texas is a state in the South Central region of the United States. At 268,596 square miles
                (695,662 km2), and with more than 30 million residents in 2022, it is the second-largest
                U.S. state by both area (after Alaska) and population (after California). Texas shares borders with 
                the states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to 
                the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south and 
                southwest; and has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast." -wiki</P>
