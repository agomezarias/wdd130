            <p>Hello! My name is Alberto Gomez Arias and I currently live in Fort Worth, Texas.
                Moved here about 5 years ago from Colorado in order to be able to better provide
                for my family. I am looking forward to continuing my education for increased opportunities
                both spiritually and in my career. My inpiration, and person that I give credit to, for encouraging
                me to return back to school is my wife Ashley. This past summer, we had the opportunity to visit 
                BYU-Idaho in order to attend her graduation and witness her accomplishment with our children present. 
                It was such a milestone in our lives that she accomplished her goal that for a long time seemed out of
                reach. Shortly after returning home from our trip, I knew that I wanted to be able to return to school
                because of the example she had set. Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

            <P>"Texas is a state in the South Central region of the United States. At 268,596 square miles
                (695,662 km2), and with more than 30 million residents in 2022, it is the second-largest
                U.S. state by both area (after Alaska) and population (after California). Texas shares borders with 
                the states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to 
                the west, and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas to the south and 
                southwest; and has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast." -wiki</P>
